## **Y**et **A**nother **M**astering **S**uite:

An audio plugin for a 30 second master. This plugin was submitted to the Audio Engineering Society’s Saul Walker student design competition in May 2021. Developed by Adam Murdock and William Holk for a joint submission.

The premise of the plugin was to develop a quick and dirty mastering solution. If you want to send a client an approximate version of what their mix might sound like mastered you can get a great sound with the 6 simple controls.

## Features

- **<u>Tone</u>** - A straightforward tilt EQ style design was used to use fewer controls and speed up the workflow.
- **<u>Saturation</u>** - A split stage, soft clipping design, adding harmonic distortion before and after the tone section.
- **<u>Compressor</u>** - A simple compressor with release time calculated based on session’s bpm to get smoother results.
- **<u>Limiter</u>** - A limiter using two compressors, in combination with a hard clipper set at 0dB.
